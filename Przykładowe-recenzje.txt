Ocena: 10/10

This is good old fashion entertainment, light hearted and funny. Just immerse yourself in this movie and enjoy, it is a great watch. Very clever filming, it is so like a video game in the way it is acted out. This is just a really good film.

Ocena: 9/10

We were pleasantly surprised with the quality of this remake. The jokes are nonstop and witty. Characters are well fleshed out with each person playing a physical opposite of their persona outside of Jumanji. A little homage is paid to Alan Parrish at the beginning of the movie, and the movie continues, 20 years after the events of 1996.

The Rock is always fun, but shines as a scared nerd with no confidence. Karen Gillan is adorable as the socially awkward nerdy girl. Jack Black playing a self obsessed popular girl is laugh out loud funny. Kevin Hart as a shrunken jock with many assigned weaknesses is classic.

All in all a nearly perfect family comedy that rises above lowest common denominator humor. Worth the trip to see it on the big screen. You do not have to see the original to appreciate it. Not quite 10 stars because adult re-watch value is just not there.

It's good. I had no idea what to expect in all honest. I am not huge fans of other movies by these actors, but this really worked. You could see the great chemistry between them all and it paid off.

What I liked: I enjoyed how it didn't dither about at the beginning and got right into the action. Jack Black especially was brilliant and hilarious! All the actors/actresses were great but Jack Black stood out. Good mix of action and comedy throughout. I was on the edge of my seat (metaphorically) wanting them to escape the game.

Negatives: not many to be honest, couple of scenes were slightly cringe, but not off putting. Same logic goes for a couple of scenes which felt dragged out.

I think people need to forget about this being a remake of a classic film and treat it as a separate movie altogether. If you start comparing the 2 that's when it goes wrong.

Ps.. Karen Gillan. Marry me please?

Worth watching and will be going cinema for 2nd instalment.

This movie is probably the best reboot to come out in the decade it's pretty original to what if it's copying off of its a solid in comedy Kevin hart the rock and jack black are really good together this is a good late night comedy I have hopes for Jumangi: the next level hopefully it can be good anyway this is a pretty solid recommendation

The story is okay, nothing special. A fantastic cast who all to their best. Plenty of comedy, both hit and miss. Some parts of it were really boring. Most of the time I enjoyed it though.

As a fan of the original Robin Williams joint I wanted to hate this. But alas it gives you what you want truthfully. A modern take on the original as kids being transfered into a really old video game. Dwayne does his thing as does Kevin hart but the real winner here is Jack Black ...as he carries a 3 star movie to 5 stars. Kudos to you buddy.

Ocena 5/10 (negatywna)

Jumani: Welcome to the Jungle is nothing special. It has some charismatic performances in all of the main characters, although Dwayne Johnson and Kevin Hart definitely take the cake. But besides some of the natural charisma of the actors, I found most of the jokes to be very hit or miss, the script bland and the special effects weren't even that good. The script is mainly a way to get from point A to point B and the things that happen in the middle are kind of predictable and boring. Also, the movie could have easily been 20 minutes or so shorter. Anyway, it's not terrible, it does have a few good laughs and it kept me relatively entertained for most of it.

A disgrace to the original, full of talentless actors. The comedy was stale and the storyline was rather boring. I was able to complete a five page term paper while it was on screen. The graphics are the only appealing thing about it. Get new ideas, Hollywood! And get some fresh faces on the screen!

Ocena: 3/10

This sequel took so long to come to fruition, the most unbelievable thing is that the writing could still be so bad. It genuinely feels like they cast the actors first, then wrote supposedly "cool and funny" scenes about them, making it feel more like a bunch of unconnected sketches and action sequences than a real story.

The main problem is that the humour seemed almost entirely aimed at the handful of young kids in my (very busy) screening, they loved it of course; but literally everyone else... silence for the entire movie. The special effects are fine and the action sequences exciting enough, but without a half-decent story to hold it together, it all feels a bit empty.

Ultimately keep your expectations rock bottom and you can probably just go along for the ride. But 22 years after the original, I would highly recommend you give the old one another try before you bother with this.

What a load of rubbish! this never gets off the ground. It's far to predictable and not at all entertaining.

Ocena: 1/10

This is totally not a game where you throw the dice and some magic will appear in the real life, either bad or worst. Not even like Zathura. For me, the acting is not bad, but the story telling is horrible. It should maintain the story telling same as original Jumanji, or maybe like Zathura. But instead, just some kids that suck into the game and trying to safe Jumanji.

The comedy is good, laughable, but almost the end of the story, it becoming boring. Not a throwing dice kinda game, it is just a action movie in the jungle..

1 more time i would say, dont go, coz it is boring story.
